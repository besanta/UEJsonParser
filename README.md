Easy way to read, create and manipulate JSON in Blueprints.

* Encode anything with AddAnyField (LinearColor, SlateFont, Custom Blueprint Struct ... also works with UObject and every other Property type...). Only encode, no decoding.
* Encode properties of your UObjects (With AddUObjectField) recursively if they are flagged with SaveGame. 
* Compress JSON string (Archive). Read form archived JSON string.

## All Nodes
* Save / Load
![API LOAD](Docs/apiloadsave.png)

* UObject
![API UOBJ](Docs/apisetuobject.png)

* Add
![API ADD](Docs/apiadd.png)

* Get
![API GET](Docs/apiget.png)

## Sample
* To serialize datas to JSON
![Alt serialize](Docs/serialize.png?raw=true "Serialize")

* To unserialize datas from JSON
![unserialize](Docs/unserialize.png?raw=true "Unserialize")

* To successfully use AddUObjectField on your UObjects, you have to flag the relevant variables with the SaveGameFlag. 
You can locate it in the extended option of your variable.\
